# GetSimple CMS Plugin SDK
The purpose of this project is to provide a library that is:

* **portable** *(easy to add to add/remove from a plugin)*
* **unified** *(has a consistent, intuitive and stable interface)*
* **backward/forward compatible** *(works with old and new GetSimple versions)*
* **well documented**

in order to simplify the typical problems that arise during [GetSimple plugin](http://get-simple.info/wiki/) development. These problems include (but are not limited to):

* Building data structures for your plugin
* Sanitizing user inputs and avoiding XSS vulnerabilities
* Remaking/copying methods that exist in the core
* Accessing site data such as site/current user settings
* Building UI elements consistent with administration panel between versions
